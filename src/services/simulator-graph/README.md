# Simulator Graph Service

This service is responsible for taking the circuit as defined in the [Element Graph Service](../circuit-graph) and producing a purely element-based graph suitable for simulation.

## Responsibilities

- Flattening elements (and particularly integrated circuits) into evolvers
- Mapping IDs between circuit elements and evolvers for interaction and display.
